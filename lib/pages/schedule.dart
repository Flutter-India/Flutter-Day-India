              "Flutter provides a variety of widgets through which we can build any kind of UI. But more than a design, your app should be interactive to give an experience that users just fall in love with. At MakeStories, user experience matters a lot as we are a design tool for stories. One such requirement popped up when we had to create an experience for dragging, resizing, tapping and much more. Thatâ€™s when we used the default touch class of Dart Library. We could have used Gestures that represent semantic actions (for example, tap, drag, and scale) that are recognized from multiple individual pointer events, potentially even multiple individual pointers. Gestures can dispatch multiple events, corresponding to the lifecycle of the gesture (for example, drag start, drag update, and drag end).In our apps we use Gestures, Drag, Resizeable properties and add some methods for taping like ontap, stack, active, inactive, onDrag, rotation of widgets and we are also play with states, height, width in flutter.GestureDetector Allows only one function on the widget at a time either dragging or scaling but we need both of these function on same widget in our project so we have used default touch class of dart library to achieve both dragging and scaling on same widget",
